# UTS-RP21-D3-Visualization

# The main content of this project is to collect the articles and journals published by top 12 universities in Australia from 2000 to 2021, and visualize the collected data to compare the number and quality. The data is crawled from DBLP with some preprocess using a python crawler. Then the data is visualized using Javascript, and the main toolbox includes d3.js, Bar-chart-race, gapminder and streamgraph. We also write a Javascript code to compute the rank of the articles based on core ranking. The main outcome of this project is a list of papers published by researcher from Australia, a stream graph and a bar-chart-race graph showing the number of published papers of the top 12 universities in Australia, and a scatter graph showing the ranking of these papers. From these graphs we have a more clear picture of the research power of the top 12 universities in Australia.
